Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refferes to the engineering principles,methods and tools used to develop and maintain high quality softawares.
Through software engineering high quality applications can be build to adress and solve specific problems in the society or streamline certain processes in the community i.e whatsapp which streamlines the process of communication.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960's
The advent of software programming in 1970's
The rise of agile methodologies in 2000's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement-involves documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design-Involves designing the architecture of the application and UI.
Implementation-involves writing the lines of code based on the software design.
Testing-Involves running tests on the application ensuring it meets quality starndards and user needs.
Deployment-involves issuing the software to the client.
Maintainance-Involves updates and support to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model uses a sequential predictable flow where one process leads to another while agile breaks down the work into small manageable cycles known as sprints where customer feedback is used in refining the releases.Waterfall model is appropriate where a project has stable requirements and full scope and is not subject to changes during the development process while agile is used for project that are fast pased and dont have a full scope and the clients want to be part of every step.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software developer-responsible for the implementation phase,writing the lines of code.
2.Quality assurance engineer-designing the programme and testing plans to ensure it meets the standards.
3.Project manager-responsible for overseeing all the processes undertaken in developing the software.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enable developers to write,debug and test code.e.g VS code.
VCS assisting in tracking changes to source code and co-ordinating teamwork among team members e.g git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing requirements.can be overcome by having clearly defined and stable scope.
2.Tight deadlines.Can be overcomed by giving projects ample time for productive work to take place.
3.Technical debt.Avoiding short cuts and non standard procedures


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.unit testing involves testing a single component within a software.
2.integration involves testing interfunctionality between different modules.
3.system testing involves testing the software as a whole.
4.acceptance testing involves testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting a clear,precise and well detailed instruction to an AI model with a very specific intention.It is important in a way that it enables users get accurate and effective output based on their needs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:Tell me about wars.
Clear promp:Explain to me about the second world war and its impact to the modern society.
The improved promp results to a much educative and direct output from the AI model thereby saving me time and making my work streamlined.
